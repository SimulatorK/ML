Assignment_1.py can be run either from the command line by calling "python assignment_1.py" or from an IDE. No inputs or arguments are required.

Optionally, to not run in parallel, set (line 142) n_jobs = 1. To use all cores for parallel grid search set n_jobs = -1. 
Optionally, to not run the optimization grid search for all algorithms, set (line 139) run_grid_search = False. 

Note that this script takes a significant amount of time to run completely especially when not in parallel and when including grid search.
